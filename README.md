==============

This Git repository forms the basis of the Git training course run at Ty Menai. It is intended to provide both an example repository with most aspects of Git pre-populated, and to demonstrate the git-flow extension which provides a powerful branching system for software development.

There are three hands-on sessions:

## Resources

### Pro Git
This tutorial is based heavily on the excellent Pro Git book, which is available in print or through http://git-scm.com/book/. This tutorial covers many of the basics in (roughly) the same order as Pro Git, so you can jump to the book for an explanation or more in-depth walkthrough.

### Git Flow
A significant portion of the Git branching example is given over to git-flow, which is an extension to Git implementing the branching model described by nvie (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). git-flow is an open source project available on Github: https://github.com/nvie/gitflow.
