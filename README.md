Readme
==============

This Git repository forms the basis of the Git training course run at Ty Menai. It is intended to provide both an example repository with most aspects of Git pre-populated, and to demonstrate the git-flow extension which provides a powerful branching system for software development.

There are three hands-on sessions:

1. [Git basics](group_session_1.md)
2. [Undoing and remotes](group_session_2.md)
3. [Branching and git-flow](group_session_3.md)


## Resources

### Pro Git
This tutorial is based heavily on the excellent Pro Git book, which is available in print or through http://git-scm.com/book/. Rather than wasting our time trying to rewrite the book (and failing to improve on it), we'll use that as a reference for most sections. This tutorial covers many of the basics in (roughly) the same order as Pro Git, so you can jump to the book for an explanation or more in-depth walkthrough.
