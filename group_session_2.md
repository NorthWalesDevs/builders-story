### Tips

1. We've omitted tagging from this tutorial because we feel that most of the time it will be done by a build system rather than manually. See [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging) to find out how to do it.
2. There are a couple of tips sections in Pro Git which are worth reading to help get your environment set up: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup and  http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks.
